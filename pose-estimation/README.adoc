| The pose estimation service predicts where different body parts are located an how are they spatially relate to each
other. The implementation is based on the https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08050.pdf[Realtime Multi-Person 2D Pose Estimation using Part Affinity Fields],
 https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose[OpenPose] and
 https://github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation[tf-pose-estimation].

Service uses pre-trained https://github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation[tf-pose-estimation] TensorFlow models
  to predict the locations and the affinity of the body parts. Predictions are represented by `heatmaps`. Next
  the service applied few greedy algorithms to refine the parts in the heatmaps and to group them into poses.

==== Usage
Add the `pose-estimation` dependency to your pom (_Use the latest version available_):

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.mindmodel.services</groupId>
    <artifactId>pose-estimation</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

Create a `PoseEstimationService` with the `cmu-graph_opt.pb` pre-trained model and use it to detect the poses
in the `tourists.jpg` image:

[source,java,linenums]
----
PoseEstimationService poseEstimationService = new PoseEstimationService(
    "https://dl.bintray.com/big-data/generic/2018-05-14-cmu-graph_opt.pb", //<1>
    true);//<2>
byte[] inputImage = GraphicsUtils.loadAsByteArray("classpath:/images/tourists.jpg");
List<Body> bodies = poseEstimationService.detect(inputImage);//<3>
String bodiesJson = new JsonMapperFunction().apply(bodies); //<4>
----
<1> URI of the pre-trained, frozen Tensorflow model
<2> Download and cache the model locally.
<3> Service takes an image (or batch of images) and the produces a list of detected Bodies.. The *Body* represents a single body posture found on the image. The Body is composed of Parts connected by Limbs.
The Limb contains a `PAF` (Part Affiliation Field) estimate score and the `from` and `to` parts it connects.
The *Part* has `type` and `coordinates` in the image.
<4> Use the `JsonMapperFunction` to turn the `Body` list into JSON objects. The output JSON format looks like:

[source,json]
----
[{"id":0, "limbs": [
    {"score":8.4396105,"from":{"type":"lShoulder","y":56,"x":160},
                         "to":{"type":"lEar","y":24,"x":152}},
    {"score":10.145516,"from":{ "type":"neck","y": 56,"x":144},
                         "to":{"type":"rShoulder","y":56,"x":128}},
 {"id":1, "limbs": [
    {"score":7.85779,  "from":{"type":"neck","y":48,"x":328},
                         "to":{"type":"rHip","y":128,"x":328}},
    {"score":6.8949876,"from":{"type":"neck","y":48,"x":328 },
                         "to":{"type":"lHip","y":128,"x":304}}]
}]
----

Or the `PoseEstimateImageAugmenter` function to draw the detected body skeletons on top of the input image:

[source,java,linenums]
----
byte[] augmentedImage = new PoseEstimateImageAugmenter().apply(inputImage, bodies);
IOUtils.write(augmentedImage, new FileOutputStream("./pose-estimation/target/tourists-augmented.jpg"));
----

The annotated images would look like this:

image:{imagesdir}/../tourists-augmented.jpg[]

You can configure the `PoseEstimateImageAugmenter` to use different color schema or graphic characteristics.

==== Models

.Pre-build models to use with the Pose Estimation Service
