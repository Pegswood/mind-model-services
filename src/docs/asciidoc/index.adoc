== Introduction

Java libraries for enabling and simplifying the inference of Deep Learning models with java.

image:{imagesdir}/../reference-arch.png[width=80%, role=right]
Java wrappers for various state-of-the-art deep learning models are provided. You can use them in standalone java
application, SpringBoot microservices as well as streaming, batch and serverless programing models.

Services for different computer vision and language processing use cases are provided. The implementation relies
the https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_java[TensorFlow Java API] as well as the
https://deeplearning4j.org/docs/latest/nd4j-overview[DL4J] stack and APIs such as https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv[JavaCV],
https://deeplearning4j.org/docs/latest/nd4j-overview[ND4J] https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/tree/master/nd4j/nd4j-tensorflow[nd4j-tensorflow].
